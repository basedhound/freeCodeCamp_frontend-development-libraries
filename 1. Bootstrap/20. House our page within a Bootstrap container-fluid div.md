# [House our page within a Bootstrap container-fluid div](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/bootstrap/house-our-page-within-a-bootstrap-container-fluid-div)

Now let's make sure all the content on your page is mobile-responsive.

Let's nest your h3 element within a div element with the class container-fluid.

## Practice
1. Your div element should have the class container-fluid.
2. Each of your div elements should have closing tags.
3. Your h3 element should be nested inside a div element. -->

```
<h3 class="text-primary text-center">jQuery Playground</h3>

<div class="container-fluid">
    <h3 class="text-primary text-center">jQuery Playground</h3>
</div>
```
