# [Remove an Item from an Array](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/redux/remove-an-item-from-an-array)

Time to practice removing items from an array. The spread operator can be used here as well. Other useful JavaScript methods include `slice()` and `concat()`.

## Practice
The reducer and action creator were modified to remove an item from an array based on the index of the item. Finish writing the reducer so a new state array is returned with the item at the specific index removed.

1. The Redux store should exist and initialize with a state equal to `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`
2. `removeItem` and `immutableReducer` both should be functions.
3. Dispatching the `removeItem` action creator should remove items from the state and should NOT mutate state.

### Solution 1
```
const immutableReducer = (state = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "REMOVE_ITEM":
      // don't mutate state here or the tests will fail
      return [
        ...state.slice(0, action.index),
        ...state.slice(action.index + 1, state.length)
      ];
    // or return state.slice(0, action.index).concat(state.slice(action.index + 1, state.length));
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const removeItem = index => {
  return {
    type: "REMOVE_ITEM",
    index
  };
};

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
```


### Solution 2
```
const immutableReducer = (state = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      // Don't mutate state here or the tests will fail
      return state.filter((_, index) => index !== action.index);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const removeItem = (index) => {
  return {
    type: 'REMOVE_ITEM',
    index
  }
}

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
```
