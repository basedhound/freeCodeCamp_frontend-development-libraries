<!-- Add id Attributes to Bootstrap Elements -> https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/bootstrap/add-id-attributes-to-bootstrap-elements

Recall that in addition to class attributes, you can give each of your elements an id attribute.

Each id must be unique to a specific element and used only once per page.

Let's give a unique id to each of our div elements of class well.

Remember that you can give an element an id like this:
<div class="well" id="center-well">

Give the well on the left the id of left-well. Give the well on the right the id of right-well.

1. Your left well should have the id of left-well.
2. Your right well should have the id of right-well.

Problem Explanation
The last challenge had you adding a class to your button elements, this time you have to add id(s) to the div(s) which have the well class.

Hints
Hint 1 -> An id is declared as follows:
<element id="id(s)List"></element>

Hint 2 -> Edit the div tags which have the well class

Hint 3 -> Use different id(s) for both wells.

Hint 4 -> Give the well on the left the id of left-well and the well on the right the id of right-well. -->
