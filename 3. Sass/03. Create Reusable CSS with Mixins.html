<!-- Create Reusable CSS with Mixins -> https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/sass/create-reusable-css-with-mixins

In Sass, a mixin is a group of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout the style sheet. The definition starts with the @mixin at-rule, followed by a custom name. You apply the mixin using the @include at-rule.

@mixin reset-list {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}

nav ul {
  @include reset-list;
}
Compiles to:

nav ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}

Your mixins can also take arguments, which allows their behavior to be customized. The arguments are required when using the mixin.

@mixin prose($font-size, $spacing) {
  font-size: $font-size;
  margin: 0;
  margin-block-end: $spacing;
}

p {
  @include prose(1.25rem, 1rem);
}

h2 {
  @include prose(2.4rem, 1.5rem);
}
You can make arguments optional by giving the parameters default values.

@mixin text-color($color: black) {
  color: $color;
}

p {
  @include text-color(); /* color: black */
}

nav a {
  @include text-color(orange);
}
Write a mixin named shape and give it 3 parameters: $w, $h, and $bg-color.

Use the shape mixin to give the #square element a width and height of 50px, and the background color red. For the #rect-a element add a width of 100px, a height of 50px, and the background color blue. Finally, for the #rect-b element add a width of 50px, a height of 100px, and the background color orange.

1. You should declare a mixin named shape with 3 parameters: $w, $h, and $bg-color.
2. Your mixin should include a width property that uses the $w parameter.
3. Your mixin should include a height property that uses the $h parameter.
4. Your mixin should include a background-color property that uses the $bg-color parameter.
5. You should replace the styles inside the #square selector with a call to the shape mixin using the @include keyword. Setting a width and height of 50px, and the background color red.
6. You should replace the styles inside the #rect-a selector with a call to the shape mixin using the @include keyword. Setting a width of 100px, a height of 50px, and the background color blue.
7. You should replace the styles inside the #rect-b selector with a call to the shape mixin using the @include keyword. Setting a width of 50px, a height of 100px, and the background color orange.

Problem Explanation
Mixin is one of the great features that let developers use SASS instead of plain CSS, as it allows you to have a Function inside your Stylesheet!

To create a mixin you should follow the following scheme:

@mixin custom-mixin-name($param1, $param2, ....) {
    // CSS Properties Here...
}
And to use it in your element(s), you should use @include followed by your Mixin name, as following:

element {
    @include custom-mixin-name(value1, value2, ....);
} -->

<style type='text/scss'>
  @mixin shape($w, $h, $bg-color) {
    width: $w;
    height: $h;
    background-color: $bg-color;
  }
  
  #square {
    @include shape(50px, 50px, red);
  }
  
  #rect-a {
    @include shape(100px, 50px, blue);
  }
  
  #rect-b {
    @include shape(50px, 100px, orange);
  }
  </style>
  
  <div id="square"></div>
  <div id="rect-a"></div>
  <div id="rect-b"></div>
