# [Use @each to Map Over Items in a List](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#sass)

The last challenge showed how the @for directive uses a starting and ending value to loop a certain number of times. Sass also offers the `@each` directive which loops over each item in a list or map. On each iteration, the variable gets assigned to the current value from the list or map.

```
@each $color in blue, red, green {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}
```
A map has slightly different syntax. Here's an example:

```
$colors: (color1: blue, color2: red, color3: green);

@each $key, $color in $colors {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}
```

Note that the $key variable is needed to reference the keys in the map. Otherwise, the compiled CSS would have color1, color2... in it. Both of the above code examples are converted into the following CSS:

```
.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

.red-text {
  color: red;
}

.green-text {
  color: green;
}
```

Write an `@each` directive that goes through a list: blue, black, red and assigns each variable to a `.color-bg` class, where the color part changes for each item to the respective color. Each class should set the `background-color` to the respective color as well.

### Problem Explanation
The @each directive loops over a list and for each iteration the variable is assigned the value in the list.

Example:

```
<style type='text/scss'>
  
@each $color in white, black, blue {
  .#{$color}-font {
    color: $color;
  }
}

</style>

<div class="white-font"></div>
<div class="black-font"></div>
<div class="blue-font"></div>
```

## Practice
1. Your code should use the @each directive.
2. Your .blue-bg class should have a background-color of blue.
3. Your .black-bg class should have a background-color of black.
4. Your .red-bg class should have a background-color of red.


```
<style type='text/scss'>

  @each $color in blue, black, red {
    .#{$color}-bg {background-color: $color;}
  }
  
  div {
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
  }

</style>

<div class="blue-bg"></div>
<div class="black-bg"></div>
<div class="red-bg"></div>
```
