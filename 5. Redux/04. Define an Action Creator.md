# [Define an Action Creator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/redux/define-an-action-creator)

After creating an action, the next step is sending the action to the Redux store so it can update its state. In Redux, you define action creators to accomplish this. An action creator is simply a JavaScript function that returns an action. In other words, action creators create objects that represent action events.

### Explanation
1. A function is defined using the following syntax:

```
function functionName() {
  console.log("Do something");
}
```
Where console.log can be changed as per the need.

2. A value is returned using the return keyword

## Practice
Define a function named `actionCreator()` that returns the `action` object when called.

1. The function `actionCreator` should exist.
2. Running the `actionCreator` function should return the `action` object.
3. The returned `action` should have a key property `type` with value `LOGIN`.

```
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}
// Define an action creator here:
function actionCreator() {
  return action;
}
```
