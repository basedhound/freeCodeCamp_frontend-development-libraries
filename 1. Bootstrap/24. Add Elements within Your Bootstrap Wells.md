# [Add Elements within Your Bootstrap Wells](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/bootstrap/add-elements-within-your-bootstrap-wells)

Now we're several div elements deep on each column of our row. This is as deep as we'll need to go. Now we can add our button elements.

Nest three button elements within each of your div elements having the class name well.

### Explanation
In the last challenge, you created a div with the well class. This challenge now requires you to add 3 button elements in each of the wells.

Hint 1 - A button is declared as follows:
```<button></button>;```

## Practice
1. Three button elements should be nested within each of your div elements with class well.
2. You should have a total of 6 button elements.
3. All of your button elements should have closing tags.
