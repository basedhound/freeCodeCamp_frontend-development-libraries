# [Add Comments in JSX](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react/add-comments-in-jsx)

JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript. Sometimes, for readability, you might need to add comments to your code. Like most programming languages, JSX has its own way to do this.

To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax `{/* */}` to wrap around the comment text.

The code editor has a JSX element similar to what you created in the last challenge. Add a comment somewhere within the provided div element, without modifying the existing `h1` or `p` elements.


### Problem Explanation
You can comment as you used to do with code blocks in JavaScript /* some JS code */ but they need to wrapped by curly braces to add comments in JSX:

Single-line comment:

```
{/*<h1>Hanoi University of Science</h1>*/}
```

Multi-line comments:
```
{/*<h1>Hanoi University of Science</h1>
<p>Falculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Informatics</p>  
*/}
```
Notice: You canâ€™t use HTML comment in JSX like this:
`<!-- not working -->`

## Practice
1. The constant `JSX` should return a `div` element.
2. The `div` should contain an `h1` tag as the first element.
3. The `div` should contain a `p` tag as the second element.
4. The existing `h1` and `p` elements should not be modified.
5. The `JSX` should use valid comment syntax. 

   
```
const JSX = (
  <div>
 { /* Comment */}
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
  </div>
);
```
