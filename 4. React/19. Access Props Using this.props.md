# [Access Props Using this.props](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react/access-props-using-this-props)

The last several challenges covered the basic ways to pass props to child components. But what if the child component that you're passing a prop to is an ES6 class component, rather than a stateless functional component? The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.

Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the `this` keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with `this`. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called `data`, you write `{this.props.data}` in JSX.

## Practice
Render an instance of the `Welcome` component in the parent component `App`. Here, give `Welcome` a prop of `name` and assign it a value of a string. Within the child, `Welcome`, access the `name` prop within the `strong` tags.

1. The App component should return a single div element.
2. The child of App should be the Welcome component.
3. The Welcome component should have a prop called name.
4. The Welcome component should display the string you pass as the name prop within strong tags.

For this solution you need to remember first how to add props to your parent component:

```
<Welcome name="Jessica"/>
```

Once you have the prop set, you can use this.props in your child component.

```
<p>Hello, <strong>{this.props.name}</strong>!</p>
```

```
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
            { /* Change code below this line */ }
            <Welcome name="Jessica"/>
            { /* Change code above this line */ }
        </div>
    );
  }
};

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
          { /* Change code below this line */ }
          <p>Hello, <strong>{this.props.name}</strong>!</p>
          { /* Change code above this line */ }
        </div>
    );
  }
};
```
