# [Register a Store Listener](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/redux/register-a-store-listener)

Another method you have access to on the Redux `store` object is `store.subscribe()`. This allows you to subscribe listener functions to the store, which are called whenever an action is dispatched against the store. One simple use for this method is to subscribe a function to your store that simply logs a message every time an action is received and the store is updated.

### Explanation
Let’s break the instructions down to figure exactly what it’s asking.

*"Write a callback function that increments the global variable count every time the store receives an action, and pass this function in to the store.subscribe() method."*

We can summarize these steps into small chunks:

1. Write a callback function
2. Increment the global variable count
3. Pass function to store.subscribe() method.

**What is a “callback function” in plain English?**
A callback function is simply a function that gets called after another function is done being executed. In the real-world, it might be something like this:

```
// You drop your car off at the mechanic and you want the shop to 'call you back' when your car is fixed.
let carIsBroken = true;
const callCarOwner = () => console.log("Hello your car is done!");
const fixCar = (carIsBroken, callCarOwner) => {
  if (carIsBroken === true) {
    carIsBroken = false;
  }
  console.log(carIsBroken);
  // After the car is fixed, the last thing we do is call the car owner - that's our 'callback function'.
  callCarOwner();
};
fixCar(carIsBroken, callCarOwner);
```

**How do you increase a number variable?**
We can do this by using the “+=” operator.

```
let count = 1;
const addOne = () => (count += 1);
```

**How do you pass a function to a method?**
We can pass a function to a method the same way we might pass a variable to a method. Just pass it in as an argument!

```
function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hi!");
}
store.subscribe(sayHi);
```

## Practice
Write a callback function that increments the global variable `count` every time the store receives an action, and pass this function in to the `store.subscribe()` method. You'll see that `store.dispatch()` is called three times in a row, each time directly passing in an action object. Watch the console output between the action dispatches to see the updates take place.

1. Dispatching the `ADD` action on the store should increment the state by `1`.
2. There should be a listener function subscribed to the store using `store.subscribe`.
3. The `store.subscribe` should receive a function.
4. The callback to `store.subscribe` should also increment the global `count` variable as the store is updated.

### Solution 1
Using a function definition for the callback.

```
const ADD = 'ADD';

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

// Global count variable:
let count = 0;

// Change code below this line

const add = () => count++;
store.subscribe(add);

// Change code above this line

store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
```

### Solution 2
Using an anonymous inline callback function.

```
const ADD = 'ADD';

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

// Global count variable:
let count = 0;

// Change code below this line

store.subscribe(() => count++);

// Change code above this line

store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
```
