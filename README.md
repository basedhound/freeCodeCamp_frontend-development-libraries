```

### Redux
> Redux is a state management library for JavaScript apps, often used with React. It centralizes an app’s state in a single store so components can access and update data consistently. Redux uses actions to describe changes, and reducers to update the state based on these actions. This structure makes state changes predictable and easy to debug, especially in complex applications.

```
01. Create a Redux Store  
02. Get State from the Redux Store  
03. Define a Redux Action  
04. Define an Action Creator  
05. Dispatch an Action Event  
06. Handle an Action in the Store  
07. Use a Switch Statement to Handle Multiple Actions  
08. Use const for Action Types  
09. Register a Store Listener  
10. Combine Multiple Reducers  
11. Send Action Data to the Store  
12. Use Middleware to Handle Asynchronous Actions  
13. Write a Counter with Redux  
14. Never Mutate State  
15. Use the Spread Operator on Arrays  
16. Remove an Item from an Array  
17. Copy an Object with Object.assign 
```

### React + Redux
> React-Redux is the official Redux binding library for React. It allows React components to interact with a Redux store, letting components read from and dispatch updates to the centralized state managed by Redux. React-Redux simplifies using Redux with React by efficiently managing component updates and enabling clear, predictable state handling across the app.

```
01. Getting Started with React Redux  
02. Manage State Locally First  
03. Extract State Logic to Redux  
04. Use Provider to Connect Redux to React  
05. Map State to Props  
06. Map Dispatch to Props  
07. Connect Redux to React  
08. Connect Redux to the Messages App  
09. Extract Local State into Redux  
10. Moving Forward From Here 
```
