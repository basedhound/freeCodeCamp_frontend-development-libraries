# [Get State from the Redux Store](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/redux/get-state-from-the-redux-store)

The Redux store object provides several methods that allow you to interact with it. For example, you can retrieve the current `state` held in the Redux store object with the `getState()` method.

Retrieve data from store by using getState() method.

## Practice
The code from the previous challenge is re-written more concisely in the code editor. Use `store.getState()` to retrieve the `state` from the `store`, and assign this to a new variable `currentState`.

1. The Redux store should have a value of 5 for the initial state.
2. A variable `currentState` should exist and should be assigned the current state of the Redux store.

```
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = 5) => state
);

// Change code below this line
let currentState = store.getState();```
