# [Use Array.filter() to Dynamically Filter an Array](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react/use-array-filter-to-dynamically-filter-an-array)

The `map` array method is a powerful tool that you will use often when working with React. Another method related to `map` is `filter`, which filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array. For example, if you have an array of users that all have a property online which can be set to `true` or `false`, you can filter only those users that are online by writing:

```
let onlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.online);
```

### Explanation
1. Use `.filter()` to create a new array that only shows users online.

```
this.state.users.filter(user => user.online === true)
```

2. Use `.map()` from previous the previous exercise to list out the online users and give them a unique key.

```
usersOnline.map(user => <li key={user.username}>{user.username}</li>)
```

## Practice
In the code editor, `MyComponent`'s `state` is initialized with an array of users. Some users are online and some aren't. Filter the array so you see only the users who are `online`. To do this, first use `filter` to return a new array containing only the users whose online property is `true`. Then, in the `renderOnline` variable, map over the filtered array, and return a `li` element for each user that contains the text of their `username`. Be sure to include a unique `key` as well, like in the last challenges.

1. `MyComponent` should exist and render to the page.
2. `MyComponent`'s state should be initialized to an array of six users.
3. `MyComponent` should return a `div`, an `h1`, and then an unordered list containing `li` elements for every user whose online status is set to `true`.
4. `MyComponent` should render `li` elements that contain the `username` of each online user.
5. Each list item element should have a unique `key` attribute.

Both methods combined will first filter out the array, then list them individually.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      users: [
        {
          username: 'Jeff',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Alan',
          online: false
        },
        {
          username: 'Mary',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Jim',
          online: false
        },
        {
          username: 'Sara',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Laura',
          online: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  render() {
    const usersOnline = this.state.users.filter(user => user.online === true); // change code here
    const renderOnline = usersOnline.map(user => <li key={user.username}>{user.username}</li>); // change code here
    return (
       <div>
         <h1>Current Online Users:</h1>
         <ul>
           {renderOnline}
         </ul>
       </div>
    );
  }
};
```
