<!-- Delete Your jQuery Functions -> https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/jquery/delete-your-jquery-functions

These animations were cool at first, but now they're getting kind of distracting.

Delete all three of these jQuery functions from your document ready function, but leave your document ready function itself intact.

1. All three of your jQuery functions should be deleted from your document ready function.
2. You should leave your script element intact.
3. You should leave your $(document).ready(function() { at the beginning of your script element.
4. You should leave the document.ready function's closing }) intact.
5. You should leave your script element closing tag intact.

Problem Explanation
To delete the functions it is just as any other piece of code that you want to remove, select it and delete with the keyboard. -->

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {

  });
</script>

<!-- Only change code above this line. -->
