# [Nest CSS with Sass](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/sass/nest-css-with-sass)

Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.

Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:

```
article {
  height: 200px;
}

article p {
  color: white;
}

article ul {
  color: blue;
}
```

For a large project, the CSS file will have many lines and rules. This is where nesting can help organize your code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:

```
article {
  height: 200px;

  p {
    color: white;
  }

  ul {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

Use the nesting technique shown above to re-organize the CSS rules for both children of .blog-post element. For testing purposes, the h1 should come before the p element.

### Problem Explanation
In Sass, nesting CSS rules allows to define hierarchy selectors.
You can organize your style sheets by nesting CSS rules.
Example:

```
.title{
  strong{}
  em{}
}
```

This will be compiled into:

```
.title{}
.title strong{}
.title em{}
```

Hint 1 - You may want to change the position of “}” at line 4.

## Practice
1. Your code should re-organize the CSS rules so the h1 and p are nested in the .blog-post parent element.


```
<style type='text/sass'>
  .blog-post { 
    h1 {
     text-align: center;
     color: blue;
    }
    p {
        font-size: 20px;
    } 
  }  
</style>
```
