# [Moving Forward From Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react-and-redux/moving-forward-from-here)

Congratulations! You finished the lessons on React and Redux. There's one last item worth pointing out before you move on. Typically, you won't write React apps in a code editor like this. This challenge gives you a glimpse of what the syntax looks like if you're working with a file system on your own machine. The code should look similar, except for the use of `import` statements (these pull in all of the dependencies that have been provided for you in the challenges).

Finally, writing React and Redux code generally requires some configuration. This can get complicated quickly. If you are interested in experimenting on your own machine, the [Create React App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-react-with-create-react-app/) comes configured and ready to go.

Alternatively, you can enable Babel as a JavaScript Preprocessor in CodePen, add React and ReactDOM as external JavaScript resources, and work there as well.

## Practice
Log the message 'Now I know React and Redux!' to the console.

1. The message Now I know React and Redux! should be logged to the console.

```
console.log('Now I know React and Redux!')
```
